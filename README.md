# Address-Book
address book solution for gumtree

Address-book is a maven project so can be easily built and installed. Just do a git clone, change to the directory where .pom is and run 'mvn clean install' and that would execute the tests as part of the build as well. 

I have pretty much used a TDD approach and the acceptance criteria of the task are put in as test cases in the file "parserTest.java".

Feel free to get any clarifications or if you face issues in executing the program contact me at rahul_vinayak@hotmail.com
